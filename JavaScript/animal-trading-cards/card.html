				Lions have strong, compact bodies and powerful forelegs,
				teeth and jaws for pulling down and killing prey.<br>
				Their coats are yellow-gold,
				and adult males have shaggy manes that range in color
				from blond to reddish-brown to black.<br>
				The length and color of a lion's mane is likely determined by age,
				genetics and hormones.<br>
				Young lions have light spotting on their coats that disappears
				as they grow.<br>

 				In general, an eagle is any bird of prey more powerful than a buteo.<br>
				An eagle may resemble a vulture in build and flight characteristics
				but has a fully feathered (often crested) head and strong feet equipped
				with great curved talons.<br>
				A further difference is in foraging habits: eagles subsist mainly on live prey.<br>

			<p>
			 Great white sharks have large heads, with cone-shaped snouts.<br>
			 This shark’s body is shaped like a torpedo, making it hydrodynamic so it can
			 move easily through the water.<br> The top half of the shark’s skin is grey colored,
			  and the bottom half is white.<br> Sharks have secondary rows of teeth behind the
				front row.<br> These backup teeth are ready to move into place if a tooth is lost,
				and the teeth will continue to grow in this conveyor-belt fashion.</p>
