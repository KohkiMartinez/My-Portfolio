## About this project
This app allows you to download any videos from Twitter. 
All you need to do is copy the URL of the video you want to download, paste it, and click the "Download" button.
There are top three most downloaded videos.
You can find top three videos [here](https://github.com/KohkiMartinez/My-Portfolio/blob/master/AWS_lambda/VideoUrlsToTwitterDownloadApp/main.py/ "AWS lambda function")
You can get them by just clicking the each button.
Feel free to explore the [Twitter Media Download App](https://twittermediadownloadapp.onrender.com) 

Please note that the app is currently deployed on the render.com free plan, which has limited CPU and RAM resources. As a result, it may take approximately 40-50 seconds to retrieve your videos. However, if the app is deployed on a standard plan, the download process will be completed in just 5 seconds!
